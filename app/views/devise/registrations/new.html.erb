<h2>Not sure what <span class="important">super-curricular activities</span>  are<span class="qmark">?</span></h2>

<p>You’ve probably heard of ‘extracurricular activities’, and probably do a few of them yourself.</p> 
<p>The ‘extra’ refers to an activity being outside of your regular curriculum, e.g. doing a sport or playing an instrument.</p>
<p>Supercurricular activities are those that take your regular curriculum further.</p> 
<p>They take the subjects you study in the classroom beyond that which your teacher has taught you or what you’ve done for homework.</p>

<h2>Want some <span class="important">examples</span><span class="qmark">?</span></h2> 
<p>•   Read another book by an author you enjoyed in class</p>
<p>•   Write an article about an idea you thought up while doing your homework</p>
<p>•   Organise a debate amongst your friends on a topical issue </p>

<h2>Why are supercurricular activities <span class="important">important</span><span class="qmark">?</span></h2>
